# How to practice effectively katas

- Start testing existing code from the shallowest branch, and start refactoring it from the deepest one
- Use the “Extract Method and Override” refactoring move
- Configure your tools to get faster feedback from tests
- Lean on your editor’s automated refactorings
- If you are new to refactoring katas, follow worked examples, like Sandro Mancuso’s live stream
- If you are a veteran of refactoring katas, get focus time to practice deliberately, being aware of what you are doing and how you could improve. Take notes, they help.
