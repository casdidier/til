## definition

Tailwind is a CSS framework that speeds up the development process by allowing you to quickly write utility classes directly in your TSX markup.

In Tailwind, you style elements by adding class names. For example, adding the class "text-blue-500" will turn the <h1> text blue:

```html
<h1 className="text-blue-500">I'm blue!</h1>
```

Although the CSS styles are shared globally, each class is singularly applied to each element.
This means if you add or delete an element, you don't have to worry about maintaining separate stylesheets,
style collisions, or the size of your CSS bundle growing as your application scales.
