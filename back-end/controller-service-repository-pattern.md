# key take awy

One of the big reasons I like this pattern is that it does a great job of a separation of concerns: The Controller layer, at the top of this picture, is solely responsible for exposing the functionality so that it can be consumed by external entities (including, perhaps, a UI component). The Repository layer, at the bottom of this picture, is responsible for storing and retrieving some set of data. The Service layer is where all the business logic should go. If the business logic requires fetching/saving data, it wires in a Repository. If someone wants to access this business logic, they go through a Controller to get there.

If code is related to storage/retrieval, it should go in the Repository. If its dealing with exposing functionality, it goes in the Controller. Anything unique in the business logic would go in the Service layer. The Repository doesn’t care which component is invoking it; it blindly does what it is asked. The Service layer doesn’t care how it gets accessed, it just does its work, using a Repository where required. And the Controller is just passing the work down to the Service layer, so it can stay nice and lean.

# to remember

Controller-Service-Repository pattern can pay a lot of dividends.
It keeps your code clean, it keeps your tests simple,
and it makes it clear where new code should go.

# Analogy: Running a Restaurant

## Controller (Chef):

Role: The Chef is like the _Controller_. They receive orders, coordinate the cooking process, and handle the final presentation of the dish.
In Code: The Controller handles incoming requests, orchestrates the business logic, and manages the flow of data.
Service (Kitchen Staff):

Role: The Kitchen Staff is like the _Service_. They specialize in specific tasks - one for chopping, another for grilling, etc.
In Code: The Service contains business logic and performs specific tasks. It encapsulates functionalities related to a specific domain.
Repository (Ingredients Supplier):

Role: The Ingredients Supplier is like the _Repository_. They provide the necessary ingredients when requested by the kitchen staff.
In Code: The Repository deals with data storage and retrieval. It abstracts the data access layer, providing the necessary data to the Service.
Pros and Cons:

## Pros:

Separation of Concerns: Like in the restaurant, each role has a specific responsibility. The Controller manages the flow, the Service handles the logic, and the Repository deals with data.

Reusability: The separation allows for the reuse of Services in different scenarios. You can change the Controller or Repository without affecting the core business logic.

Testability: Each component can be tested independently. You can test the Service's logic without involving the actual data storage.

Cons:

Overhead: In a small application, the pattern might seem like an overhead. It introduces multiple layers that could be seen as unnecessary complexity.

Learning Curve: Understanding and implementing this pattern might require some time and effort, especially for beginners.

Potential Over-Abstraction: There's a risk of over-abstracting or over-engineering if not applied judiciously.

In summary, just as a restaurant divides roles among chefs, kitchen staff, and ingredient suppliers for efficiency and specialization, the Controller-Service-Repository pattern divides responsibilities in code for better organization, maintainability, and scalability. It helps manage complexity as the application grows.
