# 3 pieces together

entities, attributes, and relationships form the foundation of data modeling, which is creating a conceptual, logical, or physical representation of data for a particular purpose or context.

## Entity

In data modeling, an entity is a real-world object or concept that can be uniquely identified and described, such as a person, place, thing, event, or concept. An entity is typically represented by a table in a relational database, and each instance of the entity is represented by a row in the table.

## Attribute

An attribute is a characteristic or property of an entity, such as a name, age, address, or color. Attributes are represented by columns in the table that represents the entity.

## Relationship

A relationship is a connection or association between two or more entities.
