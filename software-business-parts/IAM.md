Connected IAM stands for Identity and Access Management. In simple terms, IAM allows you to control who has access to what and how they access it. IAM encompasses a set of tools and processes for verifying the identity of users and authorizing their access to defined resources, such as applications, tools, data, and specifying the actions they can perform on these resources.

Here's a detailed breakdown of IAM's functionalities within an organization:

1. Identity Management: IAM solutions enable the creation and management of digital identities, including usernames, passwords, roles, groups, and access permissions. These are often managed through a central repository that stores and distributes identity information to other services, providing identity verification services.

2. Authentication: Authentication is the process by which a user provides valid credentials to access a resource. Common authentication methods include usernames and passwords, biometrics (such as iris or fingerprint scans), possession of a physical token (like a smartphone or smart card), or knowledge-based authentication (e.g., passwords).

3. Authorization: Authorization determines whether a user is allowed to access a resource and what specific actions they can perform on that resource. This fine-grained control restricts how a resource can be used by a user. The principle of least privilege is often applied, granting users access only to the resources necessary for their tasks.

4. Traceability & Audit: IAM systems record and track user activities, creating audit logs that answer questions like "Who did what, when, and why?" This traceability is essential for detecting suspicious behaviors, ensuring compliance with regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, ISO 27001, GDPR), and conducting security audits.

IAM solutions often come with features like Privileged Access Management (PAM), Single Sign-On (SSO), and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to further enhance security and efficiency.

In summary, IAM is a crucial component of an organization's security infrastructure, enabling the management of digital identities, authentication, authorization, and traceability of user activities to protect resources and ensure compliance with security standards and regulations.
